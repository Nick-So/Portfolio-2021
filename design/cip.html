                that they were poorly represented in court</li>
              <li>100% of respondents think that donating money, raising awareness, and seeking legal aid are the most
                effective ways to help those affected by wrongful convictions - however, none knew where or how to go
                about doing so.</li>

            <p>Research showed that people want to get involved, but don't know how. Looking at other organizations may
              inspire ideas for how to increase engagement.

            <img src="../images/case-study-images/CIP/competitors.png">
            <p>Surprisingly, the California Innocence Project offers even more features than most of its counterparts throughout the country. This is evidence that even though the organization is making the effort to incorporate key features, there is something that is not clicking with users who visit the site.</p>

          <div class="cardsort">
            <h4>Redesigning the Sitemap</h4>
            <p>Since CIP's content is fairly robust, user testing for new features was deprioritized to focus on usability of the existing design. Testing results showed that the website's navigation was bloated and confusing.</p>

            <p>Amanda, a passionate activist with little money to spare, can easily share content on her social media

            <p>More user testing confirmed that the sitemap and userflows successfully consolidated the website's information, and made it easier for users to find their preferred method of getting involved. Additional interviews also revealed that low-income users (those likely to visit the site) may be more likely to access the site via a desktop as opposed to mobile devices.</p>

            <p>The final round of user tests indicated that a dark background with vibrant colors spoke most directly to young activists.

        <div class="reflection">
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>An organization like CIP can and should harness the power of social media to further its cause. Whether
            they speak directly to their community, or simply let others spread the word for them - the end result is an
            amplified voice that can ripple out beyond their current reach and the effects have the potential to shift
            public outlook entirely.
            Combine that push for increased social media presence with an updated look and a sleek experience that
            speaks to young activists and you have a recipe for real social change.</p>
            <p>Pivoting from a Mobile-First design to a Responsive design threw a small wrench into the project, which was a bit distressing under the time constraints. However, the team was able to make the necessary adjustments with minimal difficulty thanks to the strong direction provided by Henry. Ultimately, the team was relieved that the pivot occurred early, during low-fidelity wireframing, and not later in the process.</p>
